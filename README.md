# ElsaBot

The ElsaBot project was the Team GrandPlay entry for the OpenCV AI 2021 contest.  This project applied the OpenCV AI depth camera (OAK-D) in a fun way.

The ROS 2 framework was used for this project.  Several of the repositories on this site contain the ROS 2 packages that make up the custom code written for this project.  To better understand the architecture and implemenation, please see the project report contained in this repository.  The appendix of that document describes the other source code repositories.

Videos of the robot in action:

The repositories used for this project have been updated as needed for ROS2 Galactic. (The project PDF mentioned compatibilty with an April 2021 Rolling release.)
